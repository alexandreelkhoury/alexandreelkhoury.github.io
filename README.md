# Bot-resistant NFT minter

This a barebones MVP for a bot-resistant NFT minting app leveraging:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [OpenZeppelin Defender](https://openzeppelin.com/defender)
- [hCaptcha](https://hcaptcha.com)
- NFT smart contract deployed [on Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x8a64d4D01E0c0BbBD60e7a48b88523E0d21EFb2C)

Barely tested, let alone audited. I just built it to learn. Clearly not ready for prod.

But you're smarter, and can likely leverage these ideas to build something more robust on top of it.
